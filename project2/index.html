      <p> These are just the courses that were critical to my chosen major. Additional to these, I have taken<span id="classes" Calculus I and
        II, Physics I and II</span> as well. I would also like to point out that I have taken online courses completely separate form
        what I have taken so far in college. In my first year, I have taken Calc I and Discrete Mathematics, which are both critical
        in helping students think efficiently. In my second year, I have taken Linear Algebra and Probablity and Statistics,
        which help when it comes to the business side of things and physics side of things as well. I am still on my way to complete
        college, but I will be working on more research and senior design projects during my senior year.</p>

      <h3><u>Experience</u></h3>
      <p>Throughout my college journey, I had the opportunity to work on researches with professors under their
        mentorship and guidance. I developed websites, apps, and even games during that time. I also worked as an intern
        at local organizations like <span id="workexp">banks, buisness centers, and offices</span>. I mainly worked on the information technology side
        of things. I have personally worked on several of my own projects as well. I am still working on researches with 
        local professors and plan to expand this involvement by getting in touch with other colleges, professors, and researchers
        as well.

      <h3><u>Projects</u></h3>
      <p>
        During my highschool and college journey so far, I have engaged my self in several personal and collaborative projects.
        During my freshman year, I have built a weather app that works pretty much like iPhone's weather app. That same year, 
        I have worked on a heart beat measuring device that we had been doing as a research with my professors. During my Sophomore year, I 
        worked on <span id="auto" automobile </span> technology, specifically suspension systems. I worked on building software for vehicles' suspension system. To be
        specific, I worked on electric vehicles. That same year, I built my own casual indie <span id="game">game</span> even though it was not wide spread. During my 
        Junior year, I worked on health facility database systems. I built and implemented data base systems for medical facilities to keep up and store 
        data. This has transformed the capabilities of clinics and increased efficiency by at least 15%.
